# CMPUT379_Assign3

I Siva Chowdeswar Nandipati declare that I wrote this code all by myself using stack over flow and binarytides.com/server-client-example-c-sockets-linux as reference. 

<To Compile:

make clean 
make

<To Run>

./server 6006 
./client 6006 Address <input.txt

server binds, connects and listens for the clients and also another thread keeeps track of 30 sec timer. Client on the other hand sends in the transactions nd sleeps if the input is given with S. PThread after creation gives a possible leak. When looked it up, I tried to detach but that doesn't seem to work. Then I found a solution where it says it is part of the creation. So I am assuming that is true.
